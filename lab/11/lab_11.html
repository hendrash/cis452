        Virtual Memory Concepts</h2>
    </center>
    
    <hr>
    <h3> Overview</h3>
The purpose of this lab assignment is to conduct and interpret
experiments that
introduce&nbsp;virtual memory concepts.&nbsp; Specifically, the lab
investigates the effect of memory-intensive process execution, frame
allocation policies, and page replacement&nbsp;by observing periodic
system reports of virtual memory statistics.<br>
    <h3>&nbsp;<br>
    </h3>
    <h3> Activities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Work your way through the following exercises, demonstrating
        your knowledge of the material by answering the numbered
        questions.</li>
      <li> Submit a <span style="font-style: italic;">detailed </span>lab
report


        that includes your answers to the numbered questions.&nbsp;
        Think about what these experiments are trying to discover/illustrate.<br>

    <h3> Virtual Memory Performance Statistics</h3>
    Self-monitoring is a task performed by most operating systems - it
    is useful for administration and auditing purposes.&nbsp; Since
    there are many subsystems in a typical OS, there are many different
    performance auditing utilities.&nbsp; This lab concerns virtual
    memory, hence the primary&nbsp;tool used will be <b>vmstat</b>
    (virtual memory statistics).&nbsp; The utility programs <b>free</b>
    and <b>top</b> also give memory usage statistics.&nbsp; Begin by
    reading the man pages for these utilities to get an idea of the
    types of information they provide and the various output options
    available via command-line parameters.
    <p>The <b>vmstat</b> utility is typically used by system
      administrators to characterize the performance of a system.&nbsp;
      For example, to an administrator a large number of swapped
      processes and a large amount of active virtual memory is
      indicative of a system with a severe memory shortage (and high
      paging activity) =&gt; time to install more RAM.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp;
there are several different types of memory, and memory measures,
referred to in this lab.&nbsp; Be sure you understand the difference
and the correct use of each metric. &nbsp;Also, pay special attention
to the units; i.e. does a utility report memory usage in bytes,
kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), etc.<br>
    </p><p>Study the following test program; in particular, note its
      memory demand requirements (the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">malloc()</span> request) and its memory access profile (the loop). &nbsp;The value <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">dim</span> (dimension), is expressed as <span style="font-family: monospace;">COEFFICIENT</span>&nbsp;Kilobytes, and is used to control memory demand by creating a two-dimensional <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">dim × dim</span> matrix of integers. &nbsp;The value <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">LOOP</span> is used solely to keep the program executing long enough to observe its memory demand with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">vmstat</span> utility. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>specify what eos system you are
          working on</li>
      <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>use the <b>free</b> memory utility program to determine:&nbsp;</li><ul><li>the total amount of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical



          </span>memory (KB) on your system&nbsp;</li><li> the current amount of <span style="font-style: italic;">free </span>memory (KB)</li></ul>
        
        
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <b>2.&nbsp; Examine and observe the memory demand of an executing process:</b>
    <ul>
      <li> study the Sample Program; then compile it and run it once (to
        prime the system)</li><ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>what is your estimate of the approximate memory demand of the Sample Program?</li></ol>
      <li> start <b>vmstat</b>, make your window appropriately wide, and configure it to display statistics once
        per second; let the system stabilize</li>
      
      
      <li>in another window, execute the Sample Program again</li>
      <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li> approximately how much does the amount of free (idle) memory change?</li><li> considering your estimated memory demand of the Sample Program (question 2a), explain
        why the observed change is an expected result.</li></ol>
      
    </ul>
    <b>3.&nbsp; Examine the effect of increased demand for memory
      resources:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>on a typical EOS system, you might have around 10-12 Gb free memory. &nbsp;Adjust&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">COEFFICIENT</span> in the Sample Program to a value that causes the&nbsp;memory
demand&nbsp;of the Sample Program to be&nbsp;equal to the amount of idle (free) memory on
your machine. &nbsp;Note: if you only have 2-3 GB free, then you should slightly exceed the amount of free memory.</li>
      <ul>
        </ul><ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">the computed value for <span style="font-family: monospace;">COEFFICIENT</span> will be different on different machines -- describe and

          (as displayed in question 2b)</li><li>your memory demand should&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>exceed the
          total amount of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical</span> memory on your system (as determined
          in question 1).</li></ul><ul><li>reduce the <b><tt>LOOP</tt></b>
          parameter down to 1 (or be prepared to wait awhile).<br>
        </li></ul>
      </ul>
      <li> configure and run <b>vmstat </b>to display statistics once
        per second; include the '<span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">-a</span>' option</li>
      <li> in another window, execute the Sample Program</li>
      
      <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>observe what happens to the amount of free
        memory.&nbsp; Given your computations and the results from experiment 2 above, is this
        what you expected to see? &nbsp;Why / why not?</li><li>reference the man pages for <span style="font-weight: bold;">vmstat</span> to understand exactly what is being displayed. &nbsp;What other <span style="font-style: italic;">memory </span>field(s),
if any, changed during execution?
&nbsp;How has the amount of memory free changed before/after running the
test program? &nbsp;Speculate:&nbsp;<i>why</i> have
these fields&nbsp;changed? In other words, explain how&nbsp;the system
is adapting to the large memory demand of the program.</li></ol>
      
      
    </ul>
    <b>4.&nbsp; Examine the effect of memory access patterns:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>change the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">COEFFICIENT</span> and LOOP parameters back to their original values.&nbsp; Read the man
        pages for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">time</span> utility
        program.&nbsp; Then use <span style="font-family: monospace;">/usr/bin/time</span> together with command-line arguments as described for <span style="font-weight: bold;">time</span> to obtain complete
        statistics (i.e. run in <span style="font-style: italic;">verbose</span> mode). &nbsp;Execute and time the&nbsp;Sample Program.<b><tt><br>
          </tt></b></li>
      
      <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>obtain basic statistics</li><ul><li>what is the size of a page in Linux?</li><li>how long does the program take to run?</li></ul></ol>
      <li> change the memory access statement in the Sample Program to
        read:<br>
      </li>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>intPtr[j * dim + i] = (i + j) % count;</tt><br>
      then re-compile and re-run the program, collecting statistics on execution time.
      <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li> <i>precisely</i>, how does this change alter the program's
        memory <span style="font-style: italic;">access</span> pattern (i.e. what memory objects get "touched", and in what order)? A diagram will&nbsp;help here.</li><li>how does this change affect the program's execution
        time?</li><li> <i>precisely</i>,
why does the change have the observed effect (your answer must
incorporate an important&nbsp;concept related to virtual memory)?</li></ol>
      
      
    </ul>
    <b>5.&nbsp; Examine the use of virtual memory:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>change the memory access pattern for the Sample Program back to
        its original form.&nbsp; Change the <b><tt>LOOP</tt></b> value
        to 1.&nbsp; Adjust the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">COEFFICIENT</span> parameter in the
        Sample Program to a value that causes the&nbsp;memory demand of
        the program to exceed the total amount of <i>physical</i>
        memory on your machine (as determined in question 1 above). &nbsp;</li><ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>describe and <span style="font-style: italic;">justify </span>your computation</li></ol>
      <li> configure and run <b>vmstat</b> to display statistics once every
        second and use <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">/usr/bin/time</span> in verbose mode to execute and time
        the program<br>
      </li>
      <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li> observe <span style="font-weight: bold;">vmstat</span>
system statistics as the program executes.&nbsp; What happens to the
amount of free memory (during and after the run)? &nbsp;Describe <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> the
other fields that have changed (including non-memory fields), and describe why they have changed?<br>
      </li><li> explain how the
        operating system is adapting to the increased memory demand of the Sample
        Program.&nbsp; Include a brief discussion of the execution time
        and the number of&nbsp;page faults incurred.&nbsp; Your explanation should
        demonstrate that you understand what is happening from a virtual
        memory viewpoint.</li></ol>
