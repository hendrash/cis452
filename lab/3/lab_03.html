			<h2> CIS 452 Lab: Week 3<br>
				InterProcess Communication (IPC)&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
		</center>
		<center>
		</center><hr>
		<h3> Overview</h3>
		The purpose of this assignment is to become familiar with some
		fundamental methods of communication between processes (IPC).&nbsp;
		Every operating system provides multiple mechanisms for communicating
		between processes and/or threads; this lab specifically explores the
		use of signals and pipes.&nbsp; In order to better understand pipes, it
		also provides an introduction (or refresher) to basic UNIX file
		operations. <br>
		<h3>&nbsp;<br>
		</h3>
		<h3> Activities</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Work your way through the following exercises, demonstrating
				your
				knowledge of the material by answering the numbered questions.</li>
			<li> Write a short multi-process program that demonstrates OS-level
				interprocess communication by sending and catching&nbsp;signals.&nbsp; Both
				the lab and included programming assignment are intended to be
				completed
				with a partner as a <i>group project</i>.&nbsp; Be prepared to
				demonstrate your program.<br>
			</li>
			<li> Submit a detailed lab report.&nbsp; Include:</li><ul><li>the answers to
					the
					numbered questions</li><li>your source code</li><li>sample output for the programming assignment (script file or screenshot).<br>
				</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h3>&nbsp;<br>
		</h3>
		<h3> Signals</h3>
		Signals represent a simple, one-directional form of communication
		between processes.&nbsp; There are a number of predefined signals
		that
		exhibit a default behavior (look in <tt>/usr/include/signal.h</tt>
		and
		particularly in <tt>/usr/include/bits/signum.h</tt>
		for details) .&nbsp; For certain signals, it is possible to override
		the
		default behavior by installing a signal handler, essentially a
		function
		that defines what to do when the associated signal is
		received.&nbsp;
		The signal handler is installed (and registered) via the <b><tt>signal()</tt></b>
		system call.
		<p>Signals can originate with the user, with the operating system,
		or
		with another process.&nbsp; They can be sent from one process to
		another
		using the <b><tt>kill()</tt></b> system call - a mechanism known
		as
		raising a signal.&nbsp; (Note: it is called "kill" for historical
		reasons - it is basically a "send".) </p>
		<p>The following sample program illustrates the installation of a
		signal handler that overrides the built-in interrupt signal
		(Control-C).&nbsp;
		This
		technique allows interrupts to be used, for example, to gracefully
		shut
		down a long-running process such as a daemon: by closing all files,
		pipes
		and sockets, and terminating all child processes before exiting.&nbsp; Refer
		to
		the
		man pages to understand the use of the <tt>signal()</tt> system
		call
		and the meaning of its arguments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that this section of the lab refers to
		the&nbsp;simpler
		ANSI <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">signal
		</span>mechanism;
		modern signaling often uses the POSIX <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">sigaction </span>mechanism.<br>

			inserted</tt>
		<br>

		<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reliable Signals</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br></span>The
		original ANSI signal() mechanism had a flaw called a "race condition",
		basically a concurrency problem (more on that in future labs).
		&nbsp;Newer versions of Linux have fixed
		this problem. However, this means that code using <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">signal()</span> may
		work correctly on some (newer) systems and incorrectly on other (older) systems; hence it is
		referred to as
		unreliable.<br><br>The&nbsp;POSIX <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">sigaction()</span> mechanism&nbsp;is implemented uniformly (i.e. reliably) across all versions.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><h3>&nbsp;<br>
		</h3>
		<h3> File I/O</h3>
		This section describes some of the basics of UNIX file I/O - it is a
		prelude to understanding interprocess communication via pipes (see
		any
		UNIX reference book for more details).&nbsp; UNIX promotes
		device-independent input and output by the use of <span style="font-style: italic;">handles</span>.&nbsp;
		This
		means that handles are used for many different types of I/O (e.g.
		files,
		pipes, sockets, physical devices).&nbsp; A handle is also known as a
		file descriptor, which is basically an integer index into a table of
		entries, each of which is associated with a file or device.&nbsp;
		Each
		process is initially given the file descriptors 0, 1, 2 (accessible via
		the <b><tt>fileno()</tt></b>
		function call or the macros STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO,
		STDERR_FILENO).&nbsp; These file descriptors correspond to standard
		input (keyboard), standard output (display), and standard error
		(unbuffered display).&nbsp; The file descriptor table for a process
		initially looks like this: <br>
		&nbsp;
		<center>
			<table border="1" width="24%">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>&nbsp;[0]</td>
						<td>standard input</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>&nbsp;[1]</td>
						<td>standard output</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>&nbsp;[2]</td>
						<td>standard error</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</center>
		<p>UNIX also permits file redirection, by modifying an entry in the
		file descriptor table.&nbsp; Suppose the process that owns the
		above
		table is executing the "ls" utility, and its output is redirected
		to a
		file as in:&nbsp; "<tt>ls &gt; directory.txt</tt>".&nbsp; Then its
		file
		descriptor table would now appear as: <br>
		&nbsp; </p>
		<center>
			<table border="1" width="33%">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>&nbsp;[0]</td>
						<td>standard input</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>&nbsp;[1]</td>
						<td>WRITE directory.txt</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>&nbsp;[2]</td>
						<td>standard error</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</center>
		<p>indicating
		that the normal stdout (to the display) is instead being written to the file
		"directory.txt".</p><p>This redirection can also be performed from
		within a program by using the <b><tt>dup2()</tt></b> system call, which closes an existing file
		descriptor and points it at the same file as another file
		descriptor
		(see the man pages for details). &nbsp;As its name implies, <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">dup2</span> is used to copy or duplicate a file handle. &nbsp;The file redirection described above is implemented in the shell by using <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">dup2()</span>.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Basic I/O-related System Calls</span> </p>
		<p>Most UNIX I/O can be performed using the system calls <b><tt>open()</tt></b>,<b><tt>close()</tt></b>,<b><tt>read()</tt></b>,
		and <b><tt>write()</tt></b>.&nbsp; A file is opened by giving its
		name, the mode (read/write), and file permissions (if you are
		creating
		it).&nbsp; The associated file descriptor is returned. &nbsp;For example: </p>
		<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp; fd = open("input.dat",
			O_RDONLY);</font> <br>
		or <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Courier New,Courier"> fd =
			open("record.dat", O_RDWR | O_CREAT, 0644);</font> </p>
		<p>A file is closed by giving its file descriptor as the only
		argument:
		</p>
		<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp; close(fd);</font> </p>
		<p>Input and output (reading/writing) are symmetric system calls: </p>
		<p>&nbsp;<font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp; numRead = read(fd,
			buffer, bufSize);</font> <br>
		and <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Courier New,Courier"> numSent =
			write(fd,
			buffer, bufSize);</font> </p>
		<p>Familiarize yourself with the use of the <font face="Courier
		New,Courier">open()</font>, <font face="Courier New,Courier">close()</font>,
	<font face="Courier New,Courier">read()</font>, <font face="Courier New,Courier">write()</font>, and <font face="Courier New,Courier">dup2()</font> system calls. </p>
	<p><b>Answer the following questions:</b> </p>
	<ul>
		<li> suppose a process has used <font face="Courier New,Courier">dup2()</font>
			to make its standard output point to a file named <tt>temp</tt>.&nbsp;
			The
			process then issues a <span style="font-family: monospace;">fork()</span>
			system call to spawn a child.&nbsp; The child code issues an <span style="font-family: monospace;">exec()</span> system call to
			execute a
			different program.<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ol start="3">
		<li> where does the standard output of the child process go?&nbsp;
			Explain.<br>
		</li>
	</ol>
	
	<ul>
		<li> suppose a process issues a <span style="font-family: monospace;">fork()</span>

			New,Courier">dup2()</font>
		to make its standard output point to a file named <tt>temp</tt>.&nbsp;
		The
		child code issues an <span style="font-family: monospace;">exec()</span>
		system call to execute a different program. </li>
	</ul>
	<ol start="4">
		<li> where does the standard output of the child process go?&nbsp;

	</ol>
	<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	</h3>
	<h3> Pipes</h3>
	The <b><tt>pipe()</tt></b> system call creates a unidirectional
	communication buffer space managed by the operating system.&nbsp; It
	also initializes two file descriptors - one associated with each end
	of
	the pipe (the "writing" end and the "reading" end).&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"></span>This
	is similar to opening a file and getting a file handle back, except
	there is both a reading and a writing handle. &nbsp;Using the <font face="Courier New,Courier">read()</font> and <font face="Courier New,Courier">write()</font>
	system calls, the pipe can be used for communication by connecting a
	process to each end, and proceeding as if you are reading/writing a
	file.&nbsp; Pipe communication is <span style="font-style: italic;">unidirectional</span>;
	so typically one process (the Producer) writes to a pipe and the other
	process (the Consumer) reads from the pipe. &nbsp;Therefore, the writer
	closes their "read" handle, and the reader closes their "write" handle.<br><br>Note: redirection (as implemented via the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">dup2()</span>
	calls in the program below) is not&nbsp;required; i.e. when appropriate, pipe handles can be
	used directly for I/O, just like file handles. &nbsp;It's simply
	convenient in certain cases.<br><br>The
	following program illustrates the general concept of interprocess
	communication and many of the system calls discussed in this section of the lab.

	<h3><br></h3><h3>Lab Programming Assignment (Communicating Processes)</h3>
	Interprocess communication of some sort occurs in most significant
	programming projects.&nbsp; Asynchronous communication is an IPC
	technique often used in systems programming, where processes must be
	able to respond to a variety of possible inputs and events.&nbsp; For
	example, a child process may need to communicate to its parent that
	some condition has occurred, or not. &nbsp;Experiment with asynchronous
	IPC by writing the following program that demonstrates the use of
	signals for simple communication.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><ul>
		<li> write a parent program that:</li>
		<ul>
			<li> spawns off a child process</li><li>installs signal handler(s) for&nbsp;the two <span style="font-style: italic;">user-defined</span>
				signals (<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2</span>)</li>
			
			<li> when a user-defined signal is received, it reports the type of signal sent</li><ul><li>note: it may be necessary to reinstall your signal
					handler after a signal is received</li></ul>
			<li>terminates gracefully upon receiving a Control-C<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li> the child process should repeatedly:</li>
		<ul>
			<li> wait a random amount of time (e.g. one to five seconds)</li>
			<li> randomly send one of the two user-defined signals to its parent</li>
		</ul>
	</ul><p>The
	program that produced the sample output listed below begins by spawning
	a child process. &nbsp;It then reports the identity of any signal that
	is sent to it at random times by its child. &nbsp;Finally, the main
	program is&nbsp;terminated and shutdown gracefully via an interrupt
	(Control-C) sigHandler. </p>
