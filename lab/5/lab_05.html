        Managing Shared Memory</h2>
    </center>
    
    <hr>
    <h3> Overview</h3>
    The purpose of this assignment is to become familiar with the
    methods
    used to enable processes to create and access shared memory (as you recall, a form of InterProcess Communication).&nbsp;
    The
    UNIX IPC package will be investigated as the mechanism for
    implementing
    a multiple-process project that communicates via shared
    memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, whenever executing entities share
    data,
    it poses an instance of the Critical Section problem.&nbsp; The
    programming assignment suggests a simple synchronization method to
    solve
    this problem.<br>

    </h3>
    <h3> Shared Memory</h3>
    One of the interprocess communication (IPC) methods mentioned in
    class
    was the use of shared memory.&nbsp; Because of its speed of access
    (as
    opposed to say, files or sockets), it is a useful tool for
    application
    programmers.&nbsp; This is why shared memory is commonly supported by
    modern operating systems and utilized in many advanced applications.&nbsp; However, shared data presents users
    with an instance of what is called the Critical Section
    problem (more on this in a future lab).
    <p>Normally, each process has its own unique address space.&nbsp;
      The
      purpose of shared memory is to allow processes to communicate by
      sharing
      the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span> data area.&nbsp; Each process still has its own data
      segment,
      but with an additional shared segment mapped into its virtual
      address
      space.&nbsp; Processes may access this shared segment only via
      pointers; this is known as anonymous memory.&nbsp; The reading and modifying of memory, and hence
      process
      communication, occurs in the usual manner but with pointers.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This lab is concerned with the access mechanism itself:&nbsp;
      learning to
      use the system calls that implement and manage shared
      memory.&nbsp;
      Since shared memory is a kernel resource, programs that use it
      should
      adhere to the established resource usage pattern: request, use,
      release.&nbsp; For shared memory specifically, the resource usage
      paradigm is expressed as follows: </p>
    <ol type="a">
      a)&nbsp; create a shared memory region <br>
      b)&nbsp; attach the shared memory segment to a process' address
      space <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // <i>use the shared memory correctly</i>
      <br>
      c)&nbsp; detach the shared memory region from a process' address
      space<br>
      d)&nbsp; remove the kernel resource data structure
    </ol>
    All of the above steps have an associated system call.&nbsp; (The
    commented step is actually the Critical Section - it is under your
    program control.)&nbsp; The system calls corresponding to the above
    steps are:
    <blockquote>a)&nbsp; <b><tt>shmget()</tt></b> - this function
      creates
      a
      shared memory segment.&nbsp; It initializes a kernel data
      structure to
      manage the resource and returns a resource ID to the user.&nbsp;
      This
      ID, or handle, is used by any process wishing to access the shared
      segment. <br>
      b)&nbsp; <b><tt>shmat()</tt></b> - attaches the specified shared
      memory
      region to the address space of the calling process. <br>
      c)&nbsp; <b><tt>shmdt() </tt></b>- detaches the specified shared
      memory region. <br>
      d)&nbsp; <b><tt>shmctl()</tt></b> - used for controlling the
      resource.&nbsp; This function has different uses that range from
      returning information about the shared memory segment to locking
      the
      memory.&nbsp; It can also be used to "free" the resource; removing
      the
      shared memory segment and its associated data structures from the
      system.</blockquote>
    Refer to the man pages for additional details on these
    functions.&nbsp;
    You may also find the include files<tt> bits/ipc.h</tt> and <tt>bits/shm.h</tt>
    useful to reference.
    <p>The sample code below demonstrates the use of these system
      calls (i.e. the mechanics of obtaining and using shared memory).&nbsp; Note that this program doesn't really do anything
      useful -
      because it
      doesn't make sense for a single process to use shared memory. </p>

    <p><b>Perform the following operations and answer the questions:</b>

    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li> what exactly is being output by Sample Program 1 (i.e. what is the

    <h3>&nbsp;<br>
    </h3>
    <h3> Useful System Utilities</h3>
    The system utility "<b><tt>ipcs</tt></b>" (IPC status) displays
    information about all currently allocated kernel IPC
    resources.&nbsp;
    Use the man pages to familiarize yourself with this program.
    <p>Since shared memory is a kernel resource, it is persistent (i.e.
      it
      may remain in the system even after the creating process has
      terminated).&nbsp; Shared memory is normally deallocated via the <b><tt>shmctl()</tt></b>
      function, but the system utility "<b><tt>ipcrm</tt></b>" (IPC
      remove)
      can also be used when necessary.&nbsp; Use this utility in the
      event of
      programming errors.&nbsp; For example, if your program terminates
      before
      cleaning up, this utility can be used to free the resources. </p>
    <p><b>Perform the following operations:</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li> modify the print statement in Sample Program 1 to determine
        the
        ID of the shared memory segment</li>
      <li> insert a <b><tt>pause()</tt></b> after the print statement,
        recompile and run</li>
      <li> start a script</li>
      <li> terminate the Sample Program (<b><tt>^C</tt></b>) and run the
        <b><tt>ipcs</tt></b>

      <li> use the <b><tt>ipcrm</tt></b> utility to remove the shared
        memory
        segment</li>
      <li> re-run the <b><tt>ipcs</tt></b> utility to verify that it
        worked</li>

    <h3>Programming Assignment (Readers and Writer)</h3>
Process communication using shared memory involves at least two
processes by definition, often referred to as a Reader and a
Writer.&nbsp; The programming assignment for this lab is to implement a
Writer program that creates a shared memory segment, then repeatedly
accepts an arbitrary user input string from the terminal and writes it
into shared memory.&nbsp; You must also implement a corresponding
Reader program; two instances of it will attach to the same shared
memory segment. &nbsp;The Readers will repeatedly read each new string
from the shared memory and display the string to the screen.&nbsp; The
idea is similar to the "echo" command, or to the operation of the pipe
demo Sample Program in Lab 3, except that your solution must implement <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span>
Reader processes. &nbsp;In this sense, it functions a little like the
typescript utility, which sends output to both the display and to a
file. &nbsp;Your program sends output to two different window displays.<br>
    <br>
    Write separate programs for each process type and then run each process
    in
    its own terminal window.&nbsp; This clearly and visually demonstrates the
    communication mechanism involved in using shared memory.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Observations:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>the
Writer needs to know that the current string has been displayed, so
that it may write a new string into shared memory (otherwise it would
overwrite the first string).&nbsp; The Readers need to know when a new
string has been written into shared memory, so that they can display it
(otherwise they would re-display the current string).&nbsp; The solution
to this problem does not require sophisticated synchronization
mechanisms such as semaphores or mutexes (the topic of a future lab). &nbsp;You should be able to synchronize for the
desired behavior with simple elements such as&nbsp;flag(s) and/or turn variables, which must
also be stored in shared memory so that all processes can access them.&nbsp; Note that the functionality of
this system constitutes a type of "lockstep" synchronization, which is acceptable
in this case since that is the desired behavior of the programs (writer goes, then both readers go, then writer goes, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>the Readers need to know which segment to attach to.&nbsp; The
        preferred method is for the Readers and Writer to agree upon a
        <span style="font-style: italic;">passkey</span> that
        is used to get access to the resource.&nbsp; See the man pages for
        information on
        using the function <b><tt>ftok()</tt></b> (file_to_key), which is used to
        generate a
       common key.</li>
      <li> your programs should conclude with a graceful shutdown,
        releasing
        all system resources before terminating (this would be a good use of the <b><tt>signal()</tt></b>
        mechanism introduced in Lab 3).</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Important:</b> don't lose your shared memory
        pointer!&nbsp;
        Otherwise, you will not be able to properly detach.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><br></h3><h3>Extra Credit (Chat Server)</h3>Extend
your program to function as a Chat Server, albeit one that executes on
a single machine.<br><br>The basic idea: &nbsp;instead of using one
writer and two readers, each instantiated process is <span style="font-style: italic;">both</span>
a writer and a reader. &nbsp;Anything a user types into any process in any terminal window gets
echoed to all other processes. &nbsp;The functionality is that of a chat server, such as you might have used in an online game.<br><br>Note: this is an O.S. project.
&nbsp;Your solution must use shared memory for IPC (not sockets).<br><br>Reminder: &nbsp;all extra credit is <span style="font-style: italic;">in addition</span> to the regular assignment, not in place of it.<br><br><br>
